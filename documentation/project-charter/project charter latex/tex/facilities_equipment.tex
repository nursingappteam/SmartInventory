%What lab space, testing grounds, makerspaces, etc. will you need to complete the project? Will you require any specific equipment, and if so, where will you get it (borrow, lease, purchase, outsource, already present in the lab, etc.). This section should occupy 1/2 page.
The team will use the senior design labs in ERB 208 to have a dedicated workspace to be able to work on the project distraction free, and store equipment like a bar code scanner and bar code scanner printer. Access to the Smart Hospitals Inventory in the Smart Hospital building and in the University Hall building to mark down where individual assets and non-assets are located (room, storage container type, row location, etc.), to be able to insert that data to the cloud-base database for inventory management later on. Later on access to the currently almost constructed building on campus where the assets are going to be stored for the same reason stated previously. Equipment that's not tangible that we need is a cloud-base database AWS from Amazon. Also an account with React Native. We don't need any other specific equipment because this is a software intense project.
