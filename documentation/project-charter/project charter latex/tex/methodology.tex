% This is the "What" of the project and it states what will be done to address the problem statement. This section should focus mostly on what your solution is going to be and what it is going to do (i.e., we are going to build an app, robot, device, etc. to perform some task which mitigates the problem). If someone were to ask you \textit{"What are you doing for your senior design project?"}, this is section is basically what you would tell them.

We are going to develop an inventory management application with the right approach and methodology to mitigate some of the biggest problems in inventory management. Using the app, users can fill out and submit loan equipment application forms online. This replaces the old process of having to meet the inventory administrator in person and fill out a paper form. We believe this will speed up the loaning equipment process, and save time for both the loaner and the loanee. Utilizing a cloud database, having the data automatically sync to the cloud instead of saving the file locally and manually backing up the data - will help the inventory administrator not to worry about losing the data in their machine. And last but not least, a future-proof, highly customizable inventory database system will help the administrator to add/remove any piece of equipment on demand.
